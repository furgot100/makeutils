Git clone multiple
could be like the average weight at its most basic
should ask how many repos to be downloaded
adds those links in a slice
then should run the exec command over each repo/ maybe use concurrency?


ISSUES:
clones repos to existing repo that the go file is in. ***BIG ISSUE***
slow as user is constantly pasting in repo links. Maybe read a text file with repo links?
Might be an issue where one command doesnt finish running before the first
